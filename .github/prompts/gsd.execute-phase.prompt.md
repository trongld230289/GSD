## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Execute all plans in a phase using wave-based parallel execution.

Orchestrator stays lean: discover plans, analyze dependencies, group into waves, spawn subagents, collect results. Each subagent loads the full execute-plan context and handles its own plan.

Optional wave filter:
- `--wave N` executes only Wave `N` for pacing, quota management, or staged rollout
- phase verification/completion still only happens when no incomplete plans remain after the selected wave finishes

Flag handling rule:
- The optional flags documented below are available behaviors, not implied active behaviors
- A flag is active only when its literal token appears in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If a documented flag is absent from `$ARGUMENTS`, treat it as inactive

Context budget: ~15% orchestrator, 100% fresh per subagent.

Phase: $ARGUMENTS

**Available optional flags (documentation only — not automatically active):**
- `--wave N` — Execute only Wave `N` in the phase. Use when you want to pace execution or stay inside usage limits.
- `--gaps-only` — Execute only gap closure plans (plans with `gap_closure: true` in frontmatter). Use after verify-work creates fix plans.
- `--interactive` — Execute plans sequentially inline (no subagents) with user checkpoints between tasks. Lower token usage, pair-programming style. Best for small phases, bug fixes, and verification gaps.

**Active flags must be derived from `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- `--wave N` is active only if the literal `--wave` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--gaps-only` is active only if the literal `--gaps-only` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--interactive` is active only if the literal `--interactive` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If none of these tokens appear, run the standard full-phase execution flow with no flag-specific filtering
- Do not infer that a flag is active just because it is documented in this prompt

Context files are resolved inside the workflow via `gsd-tools init execute-phase` and per-subagent `<files_to_read>` blocks.

<process>
Execute the execute-phase workflow from @/home/runner/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/workflows/execute-phase.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (wave execution, checkpoint handling, verification, state updates, routing).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--name` (required) — Workspace name
- `--repos` — Comma-separated repo paths or names. If omitted, interactive selection from child git repos in cwd
- `--path` — Target directory. Defaults to `~/gsd-workspaces/<name>`
- `--strategy` — `worktree` (default, lightweight) or `clone` (fully independent)
- `--branch` — Branch to checkout. Defaults to `workspace/<name>`
- `--auto` — Skip interactive questions, use defaults
</context>

<objective>
Create a physical workspace directory containing copies of specified git repos (as worktrees or clones) with an independent `.planning/` directory for isolated GSD sessions.

**Use cases:**
- Multi-repo orchestration: work on a subset of repos in parallel with isolated GSD state
- Feature branch isolation: create a worktree of the current repo with its own `.planning/`

**Creates:**
- `<path>/WORKSPACE.md` — workspace manifest
- `<path>/.planning/` — independent planning directory
- `<path>/<repo>/` — git worktree or clone for each specified repo

**After this command:** `cd` into the workspace and run `/gsd.new-project` to initialize GSD.

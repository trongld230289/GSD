## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Generate and update up to 9 documentation files for the current project. Each doc type is written by a gsd-doc-writer subagent that explores the codebase directly — no hallucinated paths, phantom endpoints, or stale signatures.

Flag handling rule:
- The optional flags documented below are available behaviors, not implied active behaviors
- A flag is active only when its literal token appears in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If a documented flag is absent from `$ARGUMENTS`, treat it as inactive
- `--force`: skip preservation prompts, regenerate all docs regardless of existing content or GSD markers
- `--verify-only`: check existing docs for accuracy against codebase, no generation (full verification requires Phase 4 verifier)
- If `--force` and `--verify-only` both appear in `$ARGUMENTS`, `--force` takes precedence
</objective>

<execution_context>
- Read file at: /home/runner/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/workflows/docs-update.md

Arguments: $ARGUMENTS

**Available optional flags (documentation only — not automatically active):**
- `--force` — Regenerate all docs. Overwrites hand-written and GSD docs alike. No preservation prompts.
- `--verify-only` — Check existing docs for accuracy against the codebase. No files are written. Reports VERIFY marker count. Full codebase fact-checking requires the gsd-doc-verifier agent (Phase 4).

**Active flags must be derived from `$ARGUMENTS`:**
- `--force` is active only if the literal `--force` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- `--verify-only` is active only if the literal `--verify-only` token is present in `$ARGUMENTS`
- If neither token appears, run the standard full-phase generation flow
- Do not infer that a flag is active just because it is documented in this prompt

<process>
Execute the docs-update workflow from @/home/runner/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/workflows/docs-update.md end-to-end.
Preserve all workflow gates (preservation_check, flag handling, wave execution, monorepo dispatch, commit, reporting).

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<context>
**Flags:**
- `--auto` — Automatic mode. After config questions, runs research → requirements → roadmap without further interaction. Expects idea document via @ reference.
</context>

<objective>
Initialize a new project through unified flow: questioning → research (optional) → requirements → roadmap.

**Creates:**
- `.planning/PROJECT.md` — project context
- `.planning/config.json` — workflow preferences
- `.planning/research/` — domain research (optional)
- `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md` — scoped requirements
- `.planning/ROADMAP.md` — phase structure
- `.planning/STATE.md` — project memory

**After this command:** Run `/gsd.plan-phase 1` to start execution.
</objective>

## Copilot Runtime Adapter (important)

Upstream GSD command sources may reference an `AskUserQuestion` tool (Claude/OpenCode runtime concept).

In VS Code Copilot, **do not attempt to call a tool named `AskUserQuestion`**.
Instead, whenever the upstream instructions say "Use AskUserQuestion", use **#tool:vscode/askQuestions** with:

- Combine the **Header** and **Question** into a single clear question string.
- If the upstream instruction specifies **Options**, present them as numbered choices.
- If no options are specified, ask as a freeform question.

**Rules:**
1. If the options include "Other", "Something else", or "Let me explain", and the user selects it, follow up with a freeform question via #tool:vscode/askQuestions.
2. Follow the upstream branching and loop rules exactly as written (e.g., "if X selected, do Y; otherwise continue").
3. If the upstream flow says to **exit/stop** and run another command, tell the user to run that slash command next, then stop.
4. Use #tool:vscode/askQuestions freely — do not guess or assume user intent.

<objective>
Extract implementation decisions that downstream agents need — researcher and planner will use CONTEXT.md to know what to investigate and what choices are locked.

**How it works:**
1. Load prior context (PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, STATE.md, prior CONTEXT.md files)
2. Scout codebase for reusable assets and patterns
3. Analyze phase — skip gray areas already decided in prior phases
4. Present remaining gray areas — user selects which to discuss
5. Deep-dive each selected area until satisfied
6. Create CONTEXT.md with decisions that guide research and planning

**Output:** `{phase_num}-CONTEXT.md` — decisions clear enough that downstream agents can act without asking the user again
</objective>

<context>
Phase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)

Context files are resolved in-workflow using `init phase-op` and roadmap/state tool calls.

**Mode routing:**
```bash
DISCUSS_MODE=$(node "$HOME/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs" config-get workflow.discuss_mode 2>/dev/null || echo "discuss")
```

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"assumptions"`: Read and execute @/home/runner/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase-assumptions.md end-to-end.

If `DISCUSS_MODE` is `"discuss"` (or unset, or any other value): Read and execute @/home/runner/work/get-shit-done-github-copilot/get-shit-done-github-copilot/staging/.github/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md end-to-end.

**MANDATORY:** The execution_context files listed above ARE the instructions. Read the workflow file BEFORE taking any action. The objective and success_criteria sections in this command file are summaries — the workflow file contains the complete step-by-step process with all required behaviors, config checks, and interaction patterns. Do not improvise from the summary.
</process>

<success_criteria>
- Prior context loaded and applied (no re-asking decided questions)
- Gray areas identified through intelligent analysis
- User chose which areas to discuss
- Each selected area explored until satisfied
- Scope creep redirected to deferred ideas
- CONTEXT.md captures decisions, not vague vision
- User knows next steps
</success_criteria>
